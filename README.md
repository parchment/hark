# Project Hark

## What is Hark?
Hark is web-based software with three primary functions: goal-setting, task management, and habit development. **Goal-setting**: prompts guide a user through the process of breaking down a goal into its component tasks and habits. **Task management**: actionable steps towards fulfilling a goal are tracked to give a user a sense of how much they have accomplished and how close they are to reaching their goal. **Habit development**: recurring tasks are tracked as habits in order to encourage completion in a regular and timely fashion.

## Who is Hark for?
Initial versions of Hark are designed for use by 12-15yo students (UK Year 7 & 10) participating in Oxbridge Academy Courses. It is intended as a supplement to in-person seminars, although future versions will be usable independent of instructor guidance, and may be more widely distributed.

## Why is Hark useful?
Recent studies have revealed a number of concerning trends in education: a general decrease in student attention span, a two-fold increase in behavioural issues, a 2y lag in social/emotional development, and a 77% increase in instances of self-harm. As a result, there is growing pressure to fold mental health and resilience training into traditional academic curriculum. Unfortunately, there are barriers to addressing these challenges; supplementary teacher training is typically slow or places additional burdens on teachers, in-person education often suffers due to the lack of time or trained experts, many online substitutes do not measure impact of their interventions, and one-on-one coaching is cost-prohibitive when scaled. There are strategies that can overcome some of these barriers, such as the use of structured goal-setting. When used properly, these methods have been shown to close attainment gaps by 98% over a two-year period and reduce anxiety by 91% in a one-year period. A digital tool such as Hark can deliver these methods to more students, more quickly, and more accurately, thus allowing the intervention to successfully scale in a cost-effective manner.
