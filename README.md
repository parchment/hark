# Project Hark

## What is Hark?
Hark is web-based software with three primary functions: goal-setting, task management, and habit development. **Goal-setting**: prompts guide a user through the process of breaking down a goal into its component tasks and habits. **Task management**: actionable steps towards fulfilling a goal are tracked to give a user a sense of how much they have accomplished and how close they are to reaching their goal. **Habit development**: recurring tasks are tracked as habits in order to encourage completion in a regular and timely fashion.
